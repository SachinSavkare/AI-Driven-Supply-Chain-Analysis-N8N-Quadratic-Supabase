## 🚀 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how we used AI tools like **Quadratic** and **n8n** to automate and analyze complex supply chain operations for a fictional FMCG company – **Atlique Mart**.  
By integrating email-based data ingestion, PostgreSQL (via Supabase), and an AI-powered spreadsheet interface, we performed **deep analytics** on fulfillment, order cycle, delivery reliability, and demand patterns.

> 🎯 **Objective**: Automate data processing and generate SCOR-based performance KPIs using modern AI tools for smarter decision-making.

## 🛠️ Automation Workflow (n8n)

![Step 1 - n8n Workflow](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Driven-Supply-Chain-Analysis-N8N-Quadratic-Supabase/blob/main/Workflow.png)

- Watch Gmail for 3PL shipment emails (India & USA)
- Extract attached CSVs (e.g., `fact_order_line_India_*.csv`)
- Convert CSV → JSON → Cleaned → Uploaded to Supabase
- Data appended daily after verifying date cutoff (e.g., `2025-05-16`)

---

## 🧽 Data Cleaning & Summary Table

![Step 2 - Data Cleaning](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Driven-Supply-Chain-Analysis-N8N-Quadratic-Supabase/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning.png)

- Loaded all dimension & fact tables:
  - `dim_customer`, `dim_product`, `dim_target_orders`
  - `fact_order_line`, `fact_aggregate`, `dim_date`, `exchange_rate`
- Cleaned: nulls, data types, whitespaces
- Generated new consolidated table: `fact_summary`

---

## 📊 Calculated KPIs (SCOR-aligned)

![Step 3 - KPIs](https://github.com/SachinSavkare/AI-Driven-Supply-Chain-Analysis-N8N-Quadratic-Supabase/blob/main/Domain.png)

The following KPIs were calculated in the fact_summary table:

- ✅ **OTIF %** (On Time In Full)
- 🕒 **Order Cycle Time** (in days)
- ⏱ **Average Delivery Delay**
- 📦 **Backorder Quantity**
- 📈 **Lead Time Variability**
- 📉 **Category Demand Variability**
- 🧮 **Total Order Lines**, **Total Orders**, **Fill Rate %, etc.**

> See [Formulas Used](#-formulas-used) below.

## 📈 Insights and Business Questions (Quadratic)

![Step 4 - Business Questions]

AI-generated answers to business questions using natural language prompts in Quadratic:

### ✅ Exercise 1:
1. Show me Monthly On time Performnace by Cities  
2. Show me top 5 customers based on order value and their OTIF %, IF %, OT %.  
3. Show me top 5 customers in India based on order value and their OTIF %, IF %, OT %.  
4. Quantify the revenue loss attributed to undelivered orders  
5. Identify customers with the most significant OTIF discrepancies  
6. Determine product categories that exhibit low 'In Full' delivery rates  
7. Calculate the average delay time for late deliveries  
8. Identify product categories with the lowest 'In Full' delivery rates  

### 📊 Exercise 2:
1. Which product categories are facing the highest fulfillment and delivery challenges?  
2. Are any customers consistently missing OTIF targets?  
3. Where is lead‑time variability threatening service levels?  
4. Which weeks experienced the worst demand swings and did that impact service?  
5. Do long delivery delays correlate with larger backorders?  
6. Which customers are improving—or worsening—in order cycle time?  
7. Are metro and non‑metro customers served differently?
